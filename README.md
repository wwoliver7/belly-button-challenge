## Project Description:

 For this project, was built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Instructions on how to explore dataset:

- Top 10 OTU's found
- Belly button Washing Frequency
